# hand-finger-attitude-recognition-tracking202112
Hand and finger recognition and tracking based on the attitude using IMU.

This project aims to gesture recognition and hand/finger tracking based only on the attitude of gesture using IMU sensors.

Since the IMU could give almost perfect attitude information, but is unable to give the position information, so this project try to achieve the attitude-based hand/finger tracking and gesture semantic recognition.

Five typical gestures consided here, they are
- pointing
- pan/move
- rotation
- scale
- grip

## What we try to get
- a prototype system including the software and hardware (but we want to exploit the third-party IMU modules)
- a video demo
- patents
- papers, ISS, MobileCHI, IPIN
